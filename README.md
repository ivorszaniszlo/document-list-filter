This project filters documents from a CSV file based on given parameters. The script accepts three parameters: document type, customer ID, and minimum total value.

## Description

This project filters and lists document data from a CSV file based on given parameters.

## Requirements

- PHPUnit 9.5 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ivorszaniszlo/document-list-filter.git
   cd document-list-filter
   ```

2. Ensure the `document_list.csv` file is in the same directory as the script.

3. Run composer install to install dependencies.

## Usage

Run the script with the following parameters:

```sh
php src/document_list.php <document_type> <customer_id> <min_total>
```

## Development

### Refactored Code

The script has been refactored to improve readability, maintainability, and performance. The main script reads data from a CSV file, filters it based on given parameters, and outputs the result.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests have been added using PHPUnit. To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Install PHPUnit:

   ```sh
   composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```sh
   vendor/bin/phpunit tests
   ```
